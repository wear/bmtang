======================
 Welcome to Comatose!
======================

Be sure and install the acts_as_tree and acts_as_list plugins!

From here you'll want to run:

  $ ./script/generate comatose_migration
  
NOTE: The generator will add the default comatose routes to the top of your routes.rb file. You'll want to move `map.comatose_root ''` to the bottom of your routes block.

When that's finished, run:

  $ rake db:migrate

That's it for the Comatose setup! 

Be sure to read the README file, and the 'Getting Started' guide. They are located at vendor/plugins/comatose/README and http://comatose.rubyforge.org/getting-started-guide respectively.
